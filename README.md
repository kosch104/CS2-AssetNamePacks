# Highway Name Remover

Now works with Mod Managers!

This mod removes display names from roads, highways, alleys, bridges and dams.

You can still change the name of a highway to a custom one, just the default values are invisible. If you want to remove a custom name, just remove all the text and hit Enter, it will then default back to the original (invisible) name.

## Dependencies

- BepInEx 5

## Installation

This mod can easily be installed using r2modman or Thunderstore Mod Manager. If you want to install it manually, follow these steps:

1. Make sure BepInEx 5 is installed
2. Download the file
3. Extract the `HighwayNameRemover.zip` file into the `BepInEx\plugins` folder

## Compatibility
- This mod is not compatible with other mods replacing the localization files (I currently don't know any mods that do)

## Further Notes
- This mod works for all languages
